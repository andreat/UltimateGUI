# UltimateGUI
A standalone GUI for Ultimate Automizer

This standalone GUI is designed to be a simple and immediate graphical interface for Ultimate Automizer. 
It just uses Ultimate Automizer as a black-box tool and provides very few options on the type of verification to be performed.

## Installation under Windows
In order to use Ultimate Automizer in Windows, the JRE 8 must be installed, which can be found in the [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) (JRE 10 and later are not supported by Ultimate Automizer yet).
Moreover, in order to be able to run Z3, which is included in Ultimate Automizer, the DLL msvcp140 must be present in the system. 
If it is not installed, it is available as part of [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48145).
